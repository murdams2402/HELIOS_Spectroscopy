# HELIOS_Spectroscopy

This code is destined to the automatation of the HELIOS experiment of the Swiss Plasma Center (SPC). Using the open-source SEABREEZE python library, this 100% python code allows an easy visualisation of HELIOS' cold plasma spectra. 

In order to run the simplified user interface, simply run the `interface.py` python scritp from your terminal. Note that it is necessary to install python (3.10 or 3.11) beforehand. Once python is downloaded on your computer, open a terminal in the `HELIOS_Spectroscopy` folder and type :
```
python interface.py
# or the following 
python3 interface.py
```
